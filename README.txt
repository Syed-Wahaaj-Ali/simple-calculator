# Simple Calculator in C

This project implements a **Simple Calculator** in **C** that can perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator, then displays the result of the chosen operation.

## Features
- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (with error handling for division by zero).

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
- **C Compiler**: Such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).
- **Command Line Interface**: To compile and run the program.
